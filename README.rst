What's this all about?
======================

This website shows how 21 billion euros of farm subsidies paid in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2007 were divided up among parliamentary constituencies.

The data was obtained by Jack Thurston, a co-founder of farmsubsidy.org, after requests to the UK Government, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Executive under freedom of information legislation. 

A small proportion of the data was missing, contained errors or the full postcode was redacted. As a result for some 2.2 billion euros (around ten per cent of the total) we have been unable to identify a precise geographical location, and hence cannot identify the parliamentary constituency.
