We worked really hard to create this database, and this site represents many
hundreds of hours of work by our team. Getting data out of governments is often
not an easy task. We often have to fight with governments through freedom of
information requests to get access to the data. Sometimes we get data in
strange formats. Sometimes we have to build web robots to extract it. Once we
have it, it takes yet more work to turn it into a useful database.

All of the many hundreds of hours of work requires funding and support,
which we are grateful to receive from our kind funders. We depend on you to
demonstrate the value of our work by attributing us as the source. By
attributing us or citing us in your news story, article, research report, radio
or TV show, website, and so on, you are, in a very direct way, helping us to
continue providing you data.

We make our database available under the Open Database License, which means
you should:

* Attribute your use of this database to us, and
* Share your changes back with everyone else.

For more on how to do both of these and the specifics, please see our legal policy (http://farmsubsidy.org/legal/), the ODbL text or our
FAQ (http://farmsubsidy.org/faq/) for details.

Have fun, and if there are any questions, please get in
